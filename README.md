# Fable

A small LISP in Erlang.

## Why?

Technical interview question with the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) to learn about interpreters.

## Interesting Make Targets

`make` will run the test suite.

## Prerquisites

Some Erlang.
Though it's heavily commented.
Reading the test suite is instructive.

Google KERL or go to `erlang-solutions.com` if you want to get Erlang/OTP.
